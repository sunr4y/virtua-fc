/**
 * Handles player retirements at the end of the season.
 *
 * Two phases:
 * 1. Retire players who announced retirement last season (retiring_at_season == oldSeason)
 *    - All retiring players are removed from the game
 *    - AIFreeAgentSigningProcessor (priority 8) signs free agents to fill AI roster gaps
 *    - SquadReplenishmentProcessor (priority 9) generates new players for remaining gaps
 * 2. Announce new retirements for the coming season based on probability algorithm
 *
 * Priority: 7 (after contract expiration/renewal, before squad replenishment)

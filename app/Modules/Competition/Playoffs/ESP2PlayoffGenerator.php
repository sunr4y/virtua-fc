 * Playoff generator for a two-round promotion playoff (semifinal + final).

 * Format:
 * - Teams at qualifying positions enter playoffs
 * - Semifinal: highest vs lowest, 2nd-highest vs 2nd-lowest (two legs, lower seed hosts first leg)
 * - Final: Winners play (two legs)
 * - Winner is promoted alongside the directly promoted teams
 *
 * Originally built for Spanish Segunda División, but parameterized via constructor
 * to support any league with the same playoff format.

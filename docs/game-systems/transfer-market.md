# Transfer Market System

How players are bought, sold, loaned, released, and contracted.

## Components

The transfer market has six interconnected parts:

1. **Scouting** — Search for players from other clubs
2. **Buying** — Bid on scouted players with counter-offer negotiation
3. **Selling** — List players and receive AI offers
4. **Loans** — Bidirectional loan system (in and out)
5. **Contracts** — Renewals, pre-contracts, and free transfers
6. **Player Release** — Unilateral contract termination by the club

## Scouting

Scouting tier (from budget allocation) determines geographic scope, search speed, number of results, and ability estimation accuracy. Higher tiers unlock international searches and reduce the fuzz on reported abilities. Search duration depends on scope breadth and tier. See `ScoutingService`.

## Buying

When bidding on a player, the selling club calculates an **asking price** based on market value, the player's importance to their team, contract length, and age. Bids are evaluated relative to the asking price — key players require higher bids. Responses are: accept, counter-offer (midpoint of bid and asking price), or reject. See `ScoutingService::evaluateBid()`.

Transfers complete immediately if the window is open, otherwise they're marked "agreed" and complete at the next window (summer or winter).

## Selling

- **Listed players** receive offers each matchday (max 3 pending). Offers arrive year-round: 40% chance per matchday during transfer windows, 15% outside windows. Offers accepted outside a window are deferred (`agreed`) and complete when the next window opens.
- **Unsolicited offers** target the team's best players with a small daily chance.
- Both offer types apply age-based adjustments and randomized pricing around market value.

Buyer selection is weighted: younger players attract stronger teams, older players attract weaker teams. Max bid is capped at a percentage of the buyer's squad value. See `TransferService`.

## Loans

**Loan out**: Each matchday has a chance of finding a destination. Destinations are scored by reputation match, position need, league tier, and randomness. Search expires after a configured number of days. Players return at season end.

**Loan in**: Via scouting, request a loan for a scouted player. The selling club evaluates and may accept.

See `LoanService` for destination scoring logic.

## Contracts

### Wages

Annual wages are calculated from market value (tiered percentage) × age modifier × random variance, with a league minimum floor. Young players get discounted "rookie" contracts; veterans command an increasing legacy premium. See `ContractService::calculateAnnualWage()`.

### Renewals

Multi-round negotiation. The player's **disposition** (flexibility) is influenced by morale, appearances, age, negotiation round, whether they have pending pre-contract offers, and **ambition** (tier gap between player and team reputation — high-tier players at low-reputation clubs are progressively harder to retain). Disposition determines how far below their demand they'll accept (max ~17% discount). Offering more/fewer contract years also adjusts the effective offer.

Players will not accept wages below their current salary (**salary floor**), except veterans (33+) with high morale who value stability over money. See `ContractService`.

### Pre-Contracts

From the winter window onward, AI clubs can approach players with expiring contracts. These are free transfers (no fee) that complete at season end.

## Player Release

The user can unilaterally terminate a player's contract at any time during the season (no transfer window required). The player becomes a free agent and may be signed by AI teams when the next transfer window closes.

### Severance

The club pays **50% of remaining contract wages** as severance. For example, a player earning €2M/year with 2 years left costs €2M in severance. The payment is recorded as a `FinancialTransaction` (category: `severance`).

### Eligibility

A release is blocked when:
- The player is on loan (in or out)
- The player has an agreed transfer or pre-contract
- The squad would drop below **20 players** (matching AI constraints)
- The position group would drop below its minimum (**2 GK, 5 DEF, 5 MID, 3 FWD**)

### Released player fate

Released players enter the **free agent pool** (`team_id = null`). They can be signed by AI teams via `AITransferMarketService` at the next window close, identical to how expired-contract free agents work.

See `ContractService::releasePlayer()`.

## Transfer Windows

- **Summer**: Matchday 0 (season start)
- **Winter**: Configured matchday (typically matchday 19)
- Agreed transfers complete at the next open window

## AI Transfer Market

When a transfer window closes, `AITransferMarketService` simulates AI-to-AI transfer activity in two phases:

### Phase 1: Free Agent Signings

Free agents (players without a team) are matched to AI teams based on position need and ability fit. Teams within 20 ability points of the player and below 26 squad size are eligible.

### Phase 2: AI-to-AI Transfers

Each AI team gets a transfer activity budget (1–5 moves in summer, 1–3 in winter). Transfers are split into two types based on club reputation:

**Squad Clearing** (~65% of transfers): Teams sell surplus/backup players to clubs of **equal or lower reputation**. Candidates are scored by position group surplus, below-average ability, and age. This represents teams trimming their squad of players they don't need.

**Talent Upgrading** (~35% of transfers): Teams sell quality players to clubs of **equal or higher reputation**. Candidates must be at or above the team average ability, with prime-age players (22–28) most attractive. This represents realistic upward mobility — good players moving to bigger clubs.

Both types respect:
- Position group minimums (2 GK, 5 DEF, 5 MID, 3 FWD) — teams won't sell below these
- Squad size floor of 20 — teams won't sell if their squad is too thin
- Squad size cap of 26 for buyers
- Per-team transfer budget caps (both buys and sells counted)

When no domestic buyer is found, there's a 50% chance of a foreign departure (player leaves the game). The user's team is excluded from all AI-to-AI activity.

See `AITransferMarketService` for the full algorithm.

## Season-End Processing

Four processors handle transfer-related transitions:

| Processor | What it does |
|-----------|-------------|
| `LoanReturnProcessor` | Returns loaned players |
| `ContractExpirationProcessor` | Releases expired contracts (user), auto-renews (AI) |
| `PreContractTransferProcessor` | Completes agreed free transfers |
| `ContractRenewalProcessor` | Applies pending wage changes |

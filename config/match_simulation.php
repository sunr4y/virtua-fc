    | Expected Goals (Ratio-Based Formula)
    |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    |
    | The xG formula uses strength RATIOS rather than shares:
    |
    |   homeXG = (strengthRatio ^ skill_dominance) × baseGoals + homeAdvantage
    |   awayXG = (1/strengthRatio ^ skill_dominance) × baseGoals
    |
    | When teams are equal (ratio=1.0), both get base_goals (1.3 xG).
    | The stronger team is ALWAYS favored regardless of venue.
    |
    | Real-world La Liga average: ~2.5 goals per match
    |
    | skill_dominance: Controls how much team quality determines match outcomes.
    | Higher values widen the xG gap between strong and weak teams, meaning
    | the better team wins more often. Lower values compress the gap, leading
    | to more upsets and tighter leagues.
    |
    |   1.0 = linear, minimal skill advantage → frequent upsets (~60/40 skill/luck)
    |   1.5 = moderate, noticeable quality gap → some upsets (~70/30)
    |   2.3 = default, strong quality gap → realistic La Liga feel (~80/20)
    |   3.0 = high, dominant teams rarely lose (~90/10)
    |   4.0 = extreme, top teams almost never drop points (~95/5)
    |
    | Example with elite (str 0.72) vs bottom (str 0.55), ratio ≈ 1.31:
    |   skill_dominance 1.0 → xG: 1.70 vs 0.99 (upset ~25% of the time)
    |   skill_dominance 2.3 → xG: 2.36 vs 0.72 (upset ~10% of the time)
    |   skill_dominance 4.0 → xG: 3.53 vs 0.48 (upset ~2% of the time)

    |

    | Each player gets a performance modifier that affects their contribution.
    |
    | performance_std_dev: Standard deviation of the bell curve (0.03-0.20)
    |   - 0.03 = very consistent, best team almost always wins
    |   - 0.05 = low variance, lineup quality is decisive (default)
    |   - 0.08 = moderate variance, some upsets
    |   - 0.20 = high variance, many upsets
    |
    | performance_min/max: Absolute bounds for performance modifier
    |   - Default 0.90-1.10 means players can perform 10% below or above their rating

    | Goal Distribution (Dixon-Coles Model)
    |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    |
    | Goals are generated using the Dixon-Coles model, an improvement over
    | independent Poisson that correlates home and away goals. This produces
    | more realistic scoreline distributions, especially for low-scoring games.
    |
    | dixon_coles_rho: Correlation between home and away goals (-0.25 to 0.00)
    |   -0.00 = no correction (equivalent to independent Poisson)
    |   -0.10 = mild correction, slightly more draws
    |   -0.13 = default, matches real football data (recommended)
    |   -0.20 = strong correction, noticeably more 0-0 and 1-1 draws
    |   -0.25 = extreme, very draw-heavy results
    |
    |   Negative rho increases 0-0 and 1-1 probabilities while slightly
    |   decreasing 1-0 and 0-1 results. This matches the real-world pattern
    |   where teams "cancel each other out" more often than Poisson predicts.
    |
    | max_goals_cap: Maximum goals a team can score (prevents 10-0 results)
    |   - 0 = no cap
    |   - 7 = realistic cap (historical max in La Liga is 9-0)
    |
    | score_concentration: How tightly results cluster around the most likely
    |   scoreline. Raises each probability to this power, then renormalizes.
    |   This is an inverse-temperature transform on the Dixon-Coles distribution.
    |
    |   1.0 = standard Dixon-Coles (default)
    |   1.5 = moderately sharper, fewer blowouts and freak results
    |   2.0 = noticeably sharper, results strongly favor the mode
    |   3.0 = very sharp, almost always the 1-2 most likely scorelines
    |   <1.0 = flatter distribution, more random (not recommended)
    |
    |   This does NOT change xG — it only changes how the final scoreline
    |   is sampled from the probability distribution.
